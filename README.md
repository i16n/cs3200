# Instructions to run

I initially wrote this program to use youplot, but realized matplotlib might work better for this. The file of interest for problem 2.A is `forwardEulerMPL.py`, and requires that you download matplotlib. I did this in a venv for simplicity. That's the only dependency. Press run and it generates graphs for each of the step sizes.
This program has just one dependency, youplot, which is a command line tool
It can be downloaded via homebrew: `brew install youplot`
It can also be downloaded in some linux distros just via `apt install youplot`
